                    Hospitality-focused, dedicated to excellence, and highly knowledgeable are just a few terms most often used to describe Frank.
                    This Ohio native was immersed in his family’s hospitality and the foodservice industry from an early age.
                    His father was an energetic and successful restaurateur in Brooklyn, Newyork, who kept Fredrick engaged in the business throughout his youth.
                    At home, his mother embodied hospitality and regularly hosted gatherings,
                    where Frank absorbed the importance of making people feel welcome.
                    These two environments gave him his strength of character and strong desire to create warm,
                    inviting atmospheres where people could relax and enjoy their favorite foods.
                     After building his own career in hospitality and foodservice, Frank pushed to explore his skills as a restaurant entrepreneur,
                     which ultimately led to the birth of Taste of Italy,
                     a great Italian experience celebrating the best ingredients, hospitality,
                     and service to the greater North East Ohio region.
